# Flight planner for DJI drones

This flight planner is created for the DJI Matrice 300 RTK with Yellowscan Mapper+ payload, but can be used in a more limited manner for different payloads. This flight planner has been used to plan multiple flights in the Netherlands. The file 'Manual DJI flight planner.pdf' provides information how the software can be used.

## Important possible limitation:
The tool uses a certain coordinate transformation and it is therefore not certain to work outside of the Netherlands. However this should be relatively easy to change.

# Flight planner for DJI drones

This flight planner is created for the DJI Matrice 300 RTK with Yellowscan Mapper+ payload, but can be used in a more limited manner for different payloads. This flight planner has been used to plan multiple flights in the Netherlands. The file 'Manual DJI flight planner.pdf' provides information how the software can be used.


## How it looks:

#### Changing flight parameters

## Important possible limitation:
The tool uses a certain coordinate transformation and it is therefore not certain to work outside of the Netherlands. However this should be relatively easy to change.


## Link to research
This flight planner has been created during the master thesis: "UAV LiDAR Point Cloud Acquisition and Quality Assessment". This thesis can be found at http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:52c1a143-1f89-4abf-bfcc-473ff98e4163
